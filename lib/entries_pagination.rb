class EntriesPagination

  ##
  # Retrieve entries from the feed passed as argument, that are in the passed state for the passed user.
  #
  # Receives as arguments:
  # - feed from which to retrieve entries.
  # - user for whom the read/unread state of each entry will be considered.
  # - include_read (optional): boolean that indicates whether to include both read and unread entries
  # (if true) or just unread entries (if false). By default this argument is false.
  # - page (optional): results page to return.
  #
  # Entries are ordered by published (first), created_at (second) and id (third). If the page argument
  # is nil, all entries are returned. If it has a value, entries are paginated and the requested page is
  # returned. Results pagination is achieved with the Kaminari gem, which uses a default page size of 25 results.
  #
  # If successful, returns an ActiveRecord::Relation with the entries.
