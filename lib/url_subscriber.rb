  # Subscribe a user to a feed. Receives as arguments the URL of the feed and the user that will be subscribed.
  #
  # First it checks if the feed is already in the database. In this case:
  #
  # - If the user is already subscribed to the feed, an AlreadySubscribedError is raised.
  # - Otherwise, the user is subscribed to the feed. The feed is not fetched (it is assumed its entries are
  # fresh enough).
  #
  # If the feed is not in the database, it checks if the feed can be fetched. If so, the feed is fetched,
  # parsed, saved in the database and the user is subscribed to it.
  #
  # If parsing the fetched response fails, it checks if the URL corresponds to an HTML page with feed autodiscovery
  # enabled. In this case the actual feed is fetched, saved in the database and the user subscribed to it.
  #
  # If the end result is that the user has a new subscription, returns the feed object.
  # If the user is already subscribed to the feed, raises an AlreadySubscribedError.
  # If the user has not been subscribed to a new feed (i.e. because the URL is not valid), returns nil.
  #
  # Note,- When searching for feeds in the database (to see if there is a feed with a matching URL, and whether the
  # user is already subscribed to it), this method is insensitive to trailing slashes, and if no URI-scheme is
  # present an "http://" scheme is assumed.
  #
  # E.g. if the user is subscribed to a feed with url "\http://xkcd.com/", the following URLs would cause an
  # AlreadySubscribedError to be raised:
  #
  # - "\http://xkcd.com/"
  # - "\http://xkcd.com"
  # - "\xkcd.com/"
  # - "\xkcd.com"
