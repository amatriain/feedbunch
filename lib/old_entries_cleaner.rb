# Class with methods related to deleting old entries from the database.

class OldEntriesCleaner

  ##
  # Delete entries above the configured max_feed_entries limit. This config option sets
  # the maximum number of entries that the app will keep for each feed.
  #
  # Receives as argument the feed for which old entries will be deleted.
  #
  # Old entries (based on their published attribute) will be deleted first, so that
  # newer entries up to max_feed_entries will be kept.do
  #
  # Deleting an entry implies destroying the Entry instance (which removes the record from the
  # entries table, as well as associated EntryState instances etc) and creating a new DeletedEntry
  # instance with the same guid and feed_id (to ensure that deleted entries won't be saved in the
  # database again, even if they are present in a feed xml retrieved in the future).
