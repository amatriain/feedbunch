# Class with methods related to normalizing URLs.

class URLNormalizer

  ##
  # Normalize the passed URL:
  # - Make sure that the URL passed as argument has an http:// or https://scheme.
  # - If the URL contains non-ascii characters, convert to ASCII using punycode
  # (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name)
  #
  # Receives as argument an URL string.
  #
  # The algorithm for scheme manipulations performed by the method is:
  # - If the URL has no scheme it is returned prepended with http://
  # - If the URL has a feed: or feed:// scheme, it is removed and an http:// scheme added if necessary.
  # For details about this uri-scheme see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_URI_scheme
  # - If the URL has an http:// or https:// scheme, it is returned untouched.
  #
  # If a nil or empty string is passed, returns nil.
