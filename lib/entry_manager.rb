# Class to save or update in the database a collection of entries fetched from a feed.

class EntryManager

  ##
  # Save new feed entries in the database.
  #
  # For each entry passed, if an entry with the same guid for the same feed already exists in the database,
  # ignore it. Also, if an entry with the same guid for the same feed has been deleted in the past, indicated
  # by a record in the deleted_entries table, ignore it. Otherwise save it as a new entry in the database.
  #
  # The argument passed are:
  # - the feed to which the entries belong (an instance of the Feed model)
  # - an Enumerable with the feed entries to save.
  # - encoding of the feed. Necessary because Feedjira sometimes receives a non-utf8 feed as input and returns a parsed
  # feed object with e.g. entry titles incorrectly marked as utf-8, when actually the internal representation is in the same encoding
  # as the input. This makes necessary converting Feedjira outputs to the input encoding.
  #
  # If during processing there is a problem with an entry, it is skipped and the next one is processed,
  # instead of failing the whole process.
