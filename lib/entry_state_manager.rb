# Class with methods related to changing the read/unread state of entries.

class EntryStateManager

  ##
  # Change the read or unread state of an entry, for a given user.
  #
  # Receives as arguments:
  # - the entry to be changed state
  # - the state in which to put it. Supported values are only "read" and "unread"; this method
  # does nothing if a different value is passed
  # - the user for which the state will be set.
  # - whole_feed (optional): boolean to indicate whether other entries in the same feed **older** than
  # the one passed as argument are to be changed state as well.
  # - whole_folder (optional): boolean to indicate whether other entries in the same folder **older** than
  # the one passed as argument are to be changed state as well.
  # - all_entries (optional): boolean to indicate whether **ALL** entries from all subscribed feeds **older**
  # than the one passed as argument are to be changed state as well.
  #
  # If the update_feed or update_folder optional named arguments are passed as true,
  # entries in the same feed/folder as the passed entry which either:
  # - have an older publish date than the passed entry
  # - or have the same publish date but a smaller id
  # are considered to be older and therefore set as read or unread depending on the "state" argument.
