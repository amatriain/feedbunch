##
# Feed model. Each instance of this model represents a single feed (Atom, RSS...) to which users can be suscribed.
#
# A single feed can have many subscriptions (from different users), but a single subscription corresponds to a single feed (one-to-many relationship).
#
# Users are associated with Feeds through the FeedSubscription model. This enables us to retrieve users that are subscribed to a feed.
#
# Feeds can be associated with folders. Each feed can be in many folders (as long as they belong to different users),
# and each folder can have many feeds (many-to-many association). However a single feed cannot be associated with
# more than one folder from the same user.
#
# Each feed can have many entries.
#
# Each feed can have many deleted_entries
#
# Each feed can be associated with many refresh_feed_job_states. Each such association represents an ocurrence of a user
# manually requesting a refresh of this feed.
#
# Each feed can be associated with many subscribe_job_states. Each such association represents an occurrence of a user
# successfully subscribing to the feed. They are transient and can be destroyed if the user dismisses the alert that informs
# him of the success subscribing to the feed; but if there is still a FeedSusbscription instance joining user and feed, the user
# is still subscribed to the feed.
#
# Each feed, identified by its fetch_url, can be present at most once in the database. Different feeds can have the same
# title, as long as they have different fetch_url.
#
# Attributes of the model:
# - title
# - fetch_url (URL to fetch the feed XML)
# - last_fetched (timestamp of the last time the feed was fetched, nil if it's never been fetched)
# - fetch_interval_secs (current interval between fetches, in seconds)
# - failing_since (if not null, feed updates have been failing since the datetime  value of this field)
# - available (if false, the feed is permanently unavailable and updates are not scheduled for it)
# - url (URL to which the user will be linked; usually the website that originated this feed)
#
# Title, fetch_url and url are sanitized (with ActionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelper) before validation; this is,
# before saving/updating each instance in the database.
