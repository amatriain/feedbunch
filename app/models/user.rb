##
# User model. Each instance of this class represents a single user that can log in to the application
# (or at least that has passed through the signup process but has not yet confirmed his email).
#
# This class has been created by installing the Devise[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise] gem and
# running the following commands:
#   rails generate devise:install
#   rails generate devise User
#
# The Devise[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise] gem manages authentication in this application. To
# learn more about Devise visit:
# {https://github.com/plataformatec/devise}[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise]
#
# Beyond the attributes added to this class by Devise[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise] for authentication,
# Feedbunch establishes relationships between the User model and the following models:
#
# - FeedSubscription: Each user can be subscribed to many feeds, but a single subscription belongs to a single user (one-to-many relationship).
# - Feed, through the FeedSubscription model: This enables us to retrieve the feeds a user is subscribed to.
# - Folder: Each user can have many folders and each folder belongs to a single user (one-to-many relationship).
# - Entry, through the Feed model: This enables us to retrieve all entries for all feeds a user is subscribed to.
# - EntryState: This enables us to retrieve the state (read or unread) of all entries for all feeds a user is subscribed to.
# - OpmlImportJobState: This indicates whether the user has ever started an OPML import, and in this case it gives information about the import
# process (whether it's still running or not, number of feeds processed, etc).
# - OpmlExportJobState: This indicates whether the user has ever started an OPML export, and in this case it gives information about the import
# process state.
# - RefreshFeedJobState: Each instance of this class associated with a user represents an ocurrence of the user requesting
# a refresh of a feed. The state attribute of the instance indicates if the refresh is running, successfully finished,
# or finished with an error.
# - SubscribeJobState: Each instance of this class associated with a user represents an ocurrence of the user trying
# to subscribe to a feed. The state attribute of the instance indicates if the subscription is running, successfully
# finished or finished with an error.
#
# Also, the User model has the following attributes:
#
# - admin: Boolean that indicates whether the user is an administrator. This attribute is used to restrict access to certain
# functionality, like ActiveAdmin and Sidekiq administration.
# - free: Boolean that indicates if the user has been granted free access to the app (if true) or if he's a paying user (if false).
# Note that regular users have this attribute set to false, even during any unpaid trial period. Only users who are never
# required to pay anything have this attribute set to true.
# - name: text with the username, to be displayed in the app. Usernames are unique. Defaults to the value of the "email" attribute.
# - locale: locale (en, es etc) in which the user wants to see the application. By default "en".
# - timezone: name of the timezone (Europe/Madrid, UTC etc) to which the user wants to see times localized. By default "UTC".
# - quick_reading: boolean indicating whether the user has enabled Quick Reading mode (in which entries are marked as read
# as soon as they are scrolled by) or not. False by default.
# - open_all_entries: boolean indicating whether the user wants to see all entries open by default when they are loaded.
# False by default.
# - show_main_tour: boolean indicating whether the main app tour should be shown when the user enters the application. True
# by default
# - show_mobile_tour: boolean indicating whether the mobile app tour should be shown when the user enters the application.
# True by default.
# - show_feed_tour: boolean indicating whether the feed tour should be shown. True by default.
# - show_entry_tour: boolean indicating whether the entry tour should be shown. True by default.
# - show_kb_shortcuts_tour: boolean indicating whether the keyboard shortcuts tour should be shown. True by default.
# - subscriptions_updated_at: datetime when subscriptions were updated for the last time. Events that
# update this attribute are:
#   - subscribing to a new feed
#   - unsubscribing from a feed
#   - changing the unread entries count for a feed
#   - changing a feed title
#   - changing a feed URL
#   - moving a feed into or out of a folder
# - folders_updated_at: datetime when folders were updated for the last time. Events that
# update this attribute are:
#   - creating a folder
#   - destroying a folder
# - refresh_feed_jobs_updated_at: datetime when refresh feed jobs for this user were updated for the last time.
# Events that update this attribute are:
#   - creating a refresh feed job state
#   - destroying a refresh feed job state
#   - updating a refresh feed job state
# - subscribe_jobs_updated_at: datetime when subscribe feed jobs for this user were updated for the last time.
# Events that update this attribute are:
#   - creating a subscribe feed job state
#   - destroying a subscribe feed job state
#   - updating a subscribe feed job state
# - config_updated_at: datetime when the config for this user was last updated. This attribute is
# updated every time one of these attributes is changed:
#   - quick_reading
#   - open_all_entries
#   - show_main_tour
#   - show_mobile_tour
#   - show_feed_tour
#   - show_entry_tour
#   - show_kb_shortcuts_tour
#   - kb_shortcuts_enabled
# - user_data_updated_at: datetime when user data for this user was last updated. This attribute is
# updated every time one of these happens:
#   - user subscribes to a new feed
#   - user unsubscribes from a feed
# - first_confirmation_reminder_sent, first_confirmation_reminder_sent: booleans that indicates if the first and second
# confirmation reminder emails have been sent to a user. This happens when a user signs up but never clicks on the link
# in the confirmation email. Each of the two confirmation reminders will be sent just once.
# - kb_shortcuts_enabled: boolean that indicates if keyboard shortcuts are enabled for a user. True by default.
#
# When a user is subscribed to a feed (this is, when a feed is added to the user.feeds array), EntryState instances
# are saved to mark all its entries as unread for this user.
#
# Conversely when a user unsubscribes from a feed (this is, when a feed is removed from the user.feeds array), all
# EntryState instances for its entries and for this user are deleted; the app does not store read/unread state for
# entries that belong to feeds to which the user is not subscribed.
#
# It is not mandatory that a user be suscribed to any feeds (in fact when a user first signs up he won't
# have any suscriptions).
