# Folder model. Each instance of this class represents a single folder to which a user can add feeds.
#
# Each folder belongs to a single user, and each user can have many folders (one-to-many relationship).
#
# Each folder can be associated with many feeds, and each feed can be associated with many folders as long as they
# belong to different users (many-to-many relationship, through the feed_folders table). However a feed can be
# associated with at most one folder belonging to a single user.
#
# A relationship is also established between Folder and Entry models, through the Feed model. This enables us to retrieve
# all entries for all feeds inside a folder.
#
# The title field is mandatory. As it is introduced by the user, it is sanitized before saving in the database.
#
# A given user cannot have two folders with the same title. Folders with the same title are allowed as long as they
# belong to different users.
#
# The subscriptions_updated_at attribute is the date/time at which a feed in the folder was last changed.
# Events that update this attribute are:
#   - unsubscribing from a feed in the folder
#   - changing the unread entries count for a feed in the folder
#   - changing the title of a feed in the folder
#   - changing the URL of a feed in the folder
#   - moving a feed into or out of the folder
