  # Imports an OPML file with subscriptions for a user, and then deletes it.

  # Receives as arguments:
  # - the name of the file, including path from Rails.root (e.g. 'uploads/1371321122.opml')
  # - the id of the user who is importing the file
  #
  # The opml_import_job_state of the user is updated with the total number of feeds so that the user can see the
  # import progress.
  #
  # After finishing the job the file will be deleted no matter what.
  #
  # Folders present in the file will be created if they don't already exist.
  #
  # After this job finishes an ImportSubscriptionsWorker superworker will be enqueued, passing the feeds and folders
  # present in the OPML as arguments. Thanks to sidekiq-superworker the actual work of importing each individual feed
  # and moving it to the corresponding folder will be delegated to lightweigth ImportSubscriptionWorker instances.
  #
  # This method is intended to be invoked from Sidekiq, which means it is performed in the background.
