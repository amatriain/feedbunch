  # Receives as arguments:
  # - ID of the OpmlImportJobState instance. This object contains a reference to the user who is importing subscriptions,
  # so it's not necessary to pass the user ID as argument
  #
  # The import job must be in state RUNNING, otherwise nothing is done. If this worker finishes successfully the job
  # state is set to SUCCESS, if an error is raised it is set to ERROR.
  #
  # The notification email is different depending on whether the import finishes successfully or with an error. In case
  # of success, any feeds which could not be imported are detailed in the email.
  #
  # This method is intended to be invoked from Sidekiq, which means it is performed in the background.
