##
# OpmlImportJobState model. Each instance of this class represents an ocurrence of a user importing subscription data
# (e.g. from Google Reader).
#
# Each OpmlImportJobState belongs to a single user, and each user can have at most only one OpmlImportJobState (one-to-one relationship).
# If a user imports data several times, each time the previous OpmlImportJobState is updated.
#
# Each OpmlImportJobState can have many OpmlImportFailures, and each OpmlImportFailure belongs to exactly one
# OpmlImportJobState (one-to-many relationship).
#
# The OpmlImportJobState model has the following fields:
# - state: mandatory text that indicates the current state of the import process. Supported values are
# "NONE" (the default), "RUNNING", "SUCCESS" and "ERROR".
# - total_feeds: number of feeds in the data file
# - processed_feeds: number of feeds in the data file already processed (the user is subscribed to the feed and
# entries have been fetched from it).
# - show_alert: if true (the default), show an alert in the Start page informing of the data import state. If false,
# the user has closed the alert related to OPML imports and doesn't want it to be displayed again.

  # Class constants for the possible states
