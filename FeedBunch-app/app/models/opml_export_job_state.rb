##
# OpmlExportJobState model. Each instance of this class represents an ocurrence of a user exporting subscription data
# in OPML format.
#
# Each OpmlExportJobState belongs to a single user, and each user can have at most only one OpmlExportJobState (one-to-one relationship).
# If a user exports data several times, each time the previous OpmlExportJobState is updated.
#
# The OpmlExportJobState model has the following fields:
# - state: mandatory text that indicates the current state of the export process. Supported values are
# "NONE" (the default), "RUNNING", "SUCCESS" and "ERROR".
# - show_alert: if true (the default), show an alert in the Start page informing of the data export state. If false,
# the user has closed the alert related to OPML exports and doesn't want it to be displayed again.
# - filename: name of the OPML file exported. It only takes value if the state is "SUCCESS"
# - export_date: GMT date and time the export was generated. It only takes value if the state is "SUCCESS"
