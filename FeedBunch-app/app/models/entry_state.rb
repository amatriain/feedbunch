##
# Entry-state model. Each instance of this class represents the state (read or unread) of a single entry for a
# single user.
#
# Each entry-state belongs to a single user, and each user can have many entry-states (one-to-many relationship).
#
# Also, each entry-state belongs to a single entry, and each entry can have many entry-states, one for each user
# subscribed to its feed (one-to-many relationship).
#
# A given entry can have at most one entry_state for a given user.
#
# The model fields are:
#
# - read: boolean. Mandatory. Indicates whether a user has read an entry or not.
# - user_id: integer. Mandatory. ID of the user who has read/unread the entry.
# - entry_id; integer. Mandatory. ID of the feed entry which is read/unread.
# - published: datetime when the entry was published. This has the same value as the "published" attribute of the
# corresponding Entry instance, it is copied to this model to denormalize the database and get faster queries.
# - entry_created_at: datetime when the entry was crated. This has the same value as the "created_at" attribute of
# the corresponding Entry instance, it is copied to this model to denormalize the database and get faster queries.
#
# New entries start in the unread state for all subscribed users when a feed is fetched. As a user reads entries,
# they are automatically marked as read unless he manually changes their state. By default, only unread entries
# are shown to the user in the view, unless he manually indicates he wants to also see read entries.
