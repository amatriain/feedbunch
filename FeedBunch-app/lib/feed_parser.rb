# Class to parse a fetched feed.

class FeedParser

  ##
  # Try to parse an HTTP response as a feed (RSS, Atom or other formats supported by Feedjira).
  #
  # If successful:
  # - saves in the database the title and URL for the feed.
  # - saves the fetched feed entries in the database.
  #
  # Any errors raised are bubbled to be handled higher up the call chain. In particular, if the response being parsed
  # is not a feed, it's likely that it's an HTML webpage, possibly with feed autodiscovery enabled. In this case
  # this function will raise an error and it's the responsibility of the calling function to capture this error and
  # handle feed autodiscovery on the HTML.
  #
  # Receives as arguments:
  # - feed object corresponding to the feed being fetched
  # - response to be parsed
  # - encoding of the feed. Necessary because Feedjira sometimes receives a non-utf8 feed as input and returns a parsed
  # feed object with e.g. title incorrectly marked as utf-8, when actually the internal representation is in the same encoding
  # as the input. This makes necessary converting Feedjira outputs to the input encoding.
  #
  # Returns the updated feed object.
